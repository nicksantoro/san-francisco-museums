Google Maps, Google Places, Google Routes APIs

Maps: Deals with maps
Places: Deals with "places" (businesses, institutions, etc...)
Routes: Deals with "routes" (coordinates, angles, etc...)

Objective:
Make a website that's a directory of museums in San Francisco.
Homepage (index.html):
-paginated (1 row, 3 per row) list of "blocks" representing museums
  -NOTE: Each place should come from the Places database (NOT hardcoded)
  -each block should have an image provided by Places
  -each block should have some other info (name, address, etc...)
  -clicking on a block should navigate to the "museum" page (with GET data in a query string)

Museum Page (museum.html):
-more info about the specific museum

TODO:
-Research Maps, Places, and Routes
  -Find example code using all 3 (in client-side JavaScript)
  -Find out how to list places of a certain type in a certain area with Places
-Start on the project
